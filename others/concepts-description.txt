App Flow:

App starts with the splash screen followed by the welcome screen
On clicking the arrow button, the user is taken into the App

Once the user enters the app, he/she is greeted and told about the recipe for the day.
Next up, the user is introduced to all the ingredients required for the recipe and teach him/her what the ingredient is and what colour and shape it is.

Once the ingredients are shown to the user, he/she is supposed to pick the right ingredients from the different racks in the store. He/she picks the required items 
and puts it into a basket.

The user gives the number of glasses of smoothie he/she wants to make.


Now, since all the ingredients are in the basket, the correct number of each ingredient is picked by the user as per the instructions given and is put into the blender. 

The animation of blending is shown and the next scene is to show the smoothie that's ready to be served.

Once the smoothie is ready, the smoothie is equally dished out into the number of glasses mentioned by the user earlier

Once this is done, the user is greeted for successfully completing the recipies
